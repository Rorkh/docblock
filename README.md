# Docblock
Simple PHP docblock reading library
# Reasoning
Because I found no lightweight libraries that can read a summary of docblock from reflection (without AST parsing).

So if you want to get some summary/tags/description from docblock without big libraries usage you can use this library I guess. It's also should be faster.
# Install
```bash
composer require zeantar/docblock
```
